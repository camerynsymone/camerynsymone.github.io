			The United States of America was built on democracy, meaning ballots and votes have been used in every election since our founding. As often as it is said, the truth is, every vote counts. As American citizens it is very important that we exercise our consistitutional right to vote in presidential elections as well as the elections related to our demographics such as judges and local council members.
